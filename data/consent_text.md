Participation in this study was voluntary and anonymous. The purpose of the study was to evaluate the perceived quality of visual explanations generated by different explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) methods.

No personally identifiable information (such as names, email addresses, contact details, or institutional identifiers) was collected. Participants were free to withdraw at any time by closing the survey without submitting their responses.

Survey responses were recorded anonymously and used solely for academic research purposes. To protect participant privacy, raw individual-level responses are not publicly released. Only aggregated statistics and summary results are reported in the associated research paper and shared in this repository.

By submitting the survey, participants consented to the use of their anonymous responses for research, analysis, and publication.
