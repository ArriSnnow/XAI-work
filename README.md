# XAI-work: Evaluating Explanation Methods on Pascal VOC 2007

This repository contains experiments comparing **Grad-CAM, Saliency maps, Integrated Gradients, and LIME** applied on a **ResNet-50** backbone using the **Pascal VOC 2007** dataset.  
We evaluate methods using **IoU** and **Insertion/Deletion AUC** metrics and complement them with a **user study** of interpretability.
